# Quote CLI

## RUNING
- `go run ./cmd/quote-cli` - for production

#### Manuel Build / run
- `go build`    - build the binary
- `./qouteCli`  - run the binary

## plans -- Stories
- TDD - TEST DRIVEN!! FROM THE START
- a program that display's a quote every time I start a terminal or with a cmd and can add new ones with cli tool
    - nice formatting (when printing)
    - a help doc / tldr
    - store in a csv -- for now
    - add a flag for a category -- "motivational", "emotinal", etc (be able to add and list flags for a qoute)

## Stories
- "sometimes while programming you need a quick burst of motivation, one that does not take you out of the flow, one that does not distract you, here it is qoutes-cli."
